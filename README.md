### Introduction
_Calories_ is an application for FitBit OS that makes it easy to keep track of your daily caloric intake and weight over time. At the moment, the main purpose is to simplify the process of calorie counting for individuals unconcerned about macro-nutrients and other miscellaneous food data. Weight data persists, but caloric data is reset daily. 

#### So the data doesn't persist? 

_At the moment_, no. I've been testing a backend for a little while now for data persistence and email updates to review total caloric surplus/deficit, but it's not quite ready for public use yet. If you're interested in Beta testing for _Calories_, send me an email at nick@xdmtk.org and I'll give you a testing build and an API key.
